# Master Thesis: Graph-Aware Next Event Prediction via GNN-Augmented Large Language Models

## 1. Background

Process mining is a discipline that sits at the intersection of data science and business process management. It aims to discover, monitor, and improve real processes by extracting knowledge from event logs readily available in today's information systems.

In business processes, predicting the next activity is crucial for proactive decision-making, resource allocation, and process optimization. While people often expect process flows to be straightforward and linear, reality is much more complex. Unexpected events, deviations, and exceptions frequently occur, making accurate next event prediction both challenging and valuable. In practice, the idealized process—a simple, linear progression—is rarely observed. Instead, actual processes are full of twists, turns, and unpredictability, reflecting the gap between expectation and reality.
